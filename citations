+This article is a critique on the methodology of the above paper, this offers some good criticism
of making pre-mature conclusions about typology with limited information which could be useful
to us when making the app. This mostly applies to families and not individuals but the ideas about
having to have more evidence to make a good typology is solid.

+Longitudianl study following first time homeless single adults. Highest predictor of long duration 
homlessness was the older age group with an arrest history. Very useful paper.

Can't figure out how to cite this, this is from a reserach symposium held by HHS and HUD about homlessness
and the fourth article has some good stuff about typology and current practices towards homlessness

+This article is really interesting in that is analyzes the robustness of a bunch of different studies on intervention programs. 
It looks at how the studies were conducted and how well the data was handled. They also include the findings from studies they found to be 
the most well done.

+This article is an interesting study on time series data analysis. Plus, it is a timely article as it delves into the fact that 
homelessness is tied positively into housing prices. It’s no great surprise that while permanent supportive housing does effect 
homelessness, it does not have a one-to-one impact where each additional bed reduces the homeless population by one person.

+Permanent housing has a positive effect on the health of people. Specifically people who are enrolled in Housing First programs are 
less likely to use substances, and they gain overall more stability in residence. What I found to be most interesting is that the 
amount of money spent on putting people in HIFi programs was ultimately less than the amount of money that is spent on people who 
aren’t given that opportunity. Essentially it costs less money to the community to give so-called “hand-outs”.

+This article is able to derive an average cost for providing homeless individuals with services, in particular housing. Plus it finds 
that providing housing has a statistically significant impact on the overall- level of chronic homelessness in the community.

+This is another study that goes over more research on the prevelance of brain injury in the homeless community. 
The main results of the study are in these quotes: "The lifetime prevalence among homeless participants was 53% for any traumatic brain injury and 12% for moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.
For 70% of respondents, their first traumatic brain injury occurred before the onset of homelessness.

+This is a study that goes over what percentage of the homeless suffer from mental illness. This can be a good study if we want to check if some of our substance abuse and mental health statistics are different from what is normally seen. I only have this here because some of our averages for our sample are strange. For example: do we really have nobody in the all of our data who had schizophrenia?

+This study is somewhat interesting as it seems fairly similar to the sort of data that we are working with. The main interesting thing about this study is just that it didn't find very much significance for many of the recorded "common risk factors" in actually predicting a return to the shelter.

+This is a really cool study that applied clustering to the homeless population to find three groups of homeless individuals: transitional, episodical, and chronic. They found that the transitional group was mostly made up of a really young population while the older homeless people with more complicating conditions usually ended up as either chronically homeless or episodically homeless.

+Not much here, just a study on schizophrenia specifically in the homeless community.

+This is a killer study, it studies almost the exact same thing that we are looking at. For there results they found that the age of the person was a large factor in them coming back as well as their background of substance abuse and housing sitatuion. This study exposes some of the limations of what we are working with in our own data as they were able to collect many more variables than we ever will be able to. They also using variables like: "living arrangments before homelessness" and, "living arrangments after homelessness." These proved to be very useful variables and looking at a study with as much data as this one is very usefull in understanding a context of the overall field of study. This is probably the most relevant study I have found towards what we are doing so far.

+This study talks about what it means to be homeless and how the line can often be blurred because of the various sorts of "dwellings" that are used by the homeless. Because of the places that are stayed in by homeless people are incredibly varied some of the data tracking chronic homeless can be innacurate when trying to be reflective on the real state of a homeless person.
