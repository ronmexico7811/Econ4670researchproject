+This article is a critique on the methodology of the above paper, this offers some good criticism
of making pre-mature conclusions about typology with limited information which could be useful
to us when making the app. This mostly applies to families and not individuals but the ideas about
having to have more evidence to make a good typology is solid.

+Longitudianl study following first time homeless single adults. Highest predictor of long duration 
homlessness was the older age group with an arrest history. Very useful paper.

Can't figure out how to cite this, this is from a reserach symposium held by HHS and HUD about homlessness
and the fourth article has some good stuff about typology and current practices towards homlessness

"Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve the Health and Housing Status of Homeless People: A Rapid Systematic Review." BMC Public Health 11, no. 1 (2011). doi:10.1186/1471-2458-11-638.
+This article is really interesting in that is analyzes the robustness of a bunch of different studies on intervention programs. 
It looks at how the studies were conducted and how well the data was handled. They also include the findings from studies they found to be 
the most well done. 

Corinth, Kevin. "The Impact of Permanent Supportive Housing on Homeless Populations." Journal of Housing Economics35 (January 31, 2017): 69-84. doi:10.1016/j.jhe.2017.01.006.
+This article is an interesting study on time series data analysis. Plus, it is a timely article as it delves into the fact that 
homelessness is tied positively into housing prices. It’s no great surprise that while permanent supportive housing does effect 
homelessness, it does not have a one-to-one impact where each additional bed reduces the homeless population by one person.

Parker, David. "Housing as an Intervention on Hospital Use: Access among Chronically Homeless Persons with Disabilities." Journal of Urban Health87, no. 6 (2010): 912-19. doi:10.1007/s11524-010-9504-y.
+Permanent housing has a positive effect on the health of people. Specifically people who are enrolled in Housing First programs are 
less likely to use substances, and they gain overall more stability in residence. What I found to be most interesting is that the 
amount of money spent on putting people in HIFi programs was ultimately less than the amount of money that is spent on people who 
aren’t given that opportunity. Essentially it costs less money to the community to give so-called “hand-outs”.

+This article is able to derive an average cost for providing homeless individuals with services, in particular housing. Plus it finds 
that providing housing has a statistically significant impact on the overall- level of chronic homelessness in the community.
